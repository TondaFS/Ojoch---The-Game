00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:24,357
This is Ojoch. Occupation - tomcat. Great lover
of comfort, delicious food and a good read.

2
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:26,655
Well, so the stock is going
up a little… oh noes, two

3
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:29,304
points down… what? … Crimea
occupied, are you kidding me?!

4
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:35,613
Yeah, and he really hates when
someone disturbs his comfort.

5
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,155
Auntie Soapie does
that all the time!

6
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:42,041
Ojoch, there is something
nasty going on in our neat

7
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:46,467
city and you are reading the newspaper?
Really??!!

8
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:50,773
Everytime Soapie says that,
the work is waiting.

9
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:56,071
No excuses! Get in and let’s fly!
No time to argue!

10
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:07,363
Meoooow, are you kidding?

11
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:10,860
I haven’t even finished
the sport news and we

12
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:15,546
should go to work? This
has to be joke. Yuck!

13
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:25,650
Come on, get in the magic bucket and let’s
fly and clean the city from all the mess.

14
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:32,095
And Ojch is already quietly sitting in his
flying bucked and following his owner.

15
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:41,285
Meooow, and who is it this time? Meoooow!

16
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:48,434
Overspice Stinkifoot! Making
a mess around the statue!!!!

17
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:55,822
One sock here, one sock there,
let’s spread the mess everywhere!

18
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:01,905
Overspice, I challange you to a fight!
Death or a broom! Ojoch, prepare bubbles!

19
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:08,048
Meooow!!! Now she needs me? Push the
button… such a complicated task!

20
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:12,564
I will not give up so easily!
You shall not wash me!

21
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:16,494
I could have stayed home. They
don’t need me here anyway!

22
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:21,692
And Ojoch eventually gave
up and let them fight.

23
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:27,240
Hmmm, maybe I could end the the
conflict a little different way?

24
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:31,475
Well, just a few bullets ...rat-tat-tat,
such cadence! weeeel, I could

25
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:36,184
handle it, but who would cook for me then?
And where would I live?

26
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:40,356
Meeeow, I guess not.

27
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:48,187
Ojoch will have to work out a better plan.
So he went away to think it over.

28
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:56,814
R.U.R., well what is it? War and peace
- well, who wrote this? All Quiet

29
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,983
on the Western Front - what a pulp fiction!
None of this will help me!

30
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:08,863
Look, this is it! Karel Gott's
Love Potion Number Ten!

31
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,133
This will solve all my problems.

32
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:19,962
So that’s the medium flame,
one plate, slightly overcook!

33
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:24,411
Just a pinch of ginger,
pinch of clove, a nutmeg.

34
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,293
Well, even Jamie Oliver
would be jealous!

35
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,765
What a nice smell!

36
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:38,716
Now just pour it into the kettle! Yes,
it has to look good, that is a must!

37
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:43,579
Yes, just dont spill anything now.
Over there,

38
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:46,938
jesus, carefully, carefully,
that’s so much love!

39
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:52,060
Heeeey!! Can you take a break for
a few minutes? It’s tea time!

40
00:03:56,476 --> 00:04:00,866
Ojoch was happy, they bought it! He saw the
spark between them! But he hide, just in case.

41
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:05,201
He doesn’t have to see everything and also ...
what if it didn’t work out?

42
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:07,851
Overspice!

43
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,247
Soapie, my love!

44
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,702
Yeeeeees!!! Wohooo!! It worked!
Heaven on earth,

45
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:16,788
no work, that’s awesome!
Reallly…. Ha! Uh-oh!

46
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:21,559
Well, what just happened? Oh noeees!!!

47
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:26,592
Yes, Ojoch spread a lot of love along
the way, but no one expected that this

48
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:31,291
love would bring the statue to life. Or
that this statue would fall in love.

49
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:38,655
Yeah, yeah, I like you too but find someone
bigger, someone like you. Heeeeeelp!!! Meow!
